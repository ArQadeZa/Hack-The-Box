Server Side template Injection is when you use native template syntax (Node.js in this case) to inject a malicious payload into a template
a example of vulnerable code would be -> $output = $twig->render("Dear" .$_GET["name"]);
in the above a part of the template is being gererated dynamically by the server, By using the GET parameter name as a entrypoint for a payload
eg. http://vulnerable-website/?name=\{bad-stuff-here\}
to detect this by using plaintext context"{{7*7}}" 
to detect code  context it could be similar to http://vulnerable-website.com/?greeting=data.username and if you are lucky the sserver wiill display the errors and you will be able to find the engine used

After finding a way to install extenal modules in node.js by using the require() function in mainProcess , use it to install child_process 
child_process -> allows you to execute system commands
